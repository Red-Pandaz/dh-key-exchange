**Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Simulation**

This program is a simplified, locally run recreation of a Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange. It uses 512-bit primes which are not considered secure by modern encryption standards and as such any keys derived from this software should not be used for in production.

As of writing this is a single file Node.JS project with all helper functions defined in ```index.js```. Future implentations may include refactoring into Python.
